# Prototype OpenStreetMap US Highway Classification

This repository is used to collaborate on files used to prototype a new US highway classification.  These changes are NOT committed to the main map at osm.org.

This demonstration is limited to the classes motorway, trunk, and primary.  In the rendering, display of primary is suppressed until zoom 10 in order to better show the trunk road network.

Data files:
* functional_highways_ne.pbf - Northeast US
* functional_highways_mw.pbf - Midwest US
* functional_highways_s.pbf - South/Southeast US
* functional_highways_w.pbf - Western US
* functional_highways_pac.pbf - Alaska & Hawaii
